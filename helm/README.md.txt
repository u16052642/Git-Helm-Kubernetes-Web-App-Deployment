Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows us to manage and install applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

The Helm chart for our web application will include the following components:

Deployment: A Deployment is an object in Kubernetes that defines the desired state of the application, including the number of replicas, the template for the application container, and the update strategy. In our Helm chart, we will create a Deployment for our Javascript hello-world application.

Service: A Service is an object in Kubernetes that defines the network access to the application. It acts as an intermediary between the application and the network, directing network traffic to the appropriate Pods. In our Helm chart, we will create a Service for our Javascript hello-world application.

ConfigMap: A ConfigMap is an object in Kubernetes that stores configuration data as key-value pairs. This is useful for storing configuration data separate from the application code, making it easier to manage and update. In our Helm chart, we will create a ConfigMap for our Javascript hello-world application to store configuration values.

Secret: A Secret is an object in Kubernetes that stores sensitive data, such as passwords or encryption keys. This is useful for storing sensitive data separate from the application code, making it more secure. In our Helm chart, we will create a Secret for our Javascript hello-world application to store sensitive values.
